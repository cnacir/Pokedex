<h2>Description</h2>

This project creates a pokemon trainer and three pokemon for his team to display for a user. The coding is done first by setting an HTML page and styling it with SASS, then using Javascript with the Axios library to perform AJAX calls to pull the data of the trainer's 3 specific pokemon from the pokeAPI and store them in their own class.

Once they are stored, Javascript is used to traverse the DOM; creating elements and appending the pokemon and their data into these elements.

Finally, again in Javascript, an event listener is added to automatically generate all this action upon the HTML pages loading.
